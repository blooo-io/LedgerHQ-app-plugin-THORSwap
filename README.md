# Ledger THORSwap Plugin

This is a plugin for the Ethereum application which helps parsing and displaying relevant information when signing a thorswap transaction.

## Prerequisite

Clone the plugin to a new folder.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/blooo-io/LedgerHQ-app-plugin-THORSwap.git
```

Then in the same folder clone two more repositories, which is the plugin-tools and app-ethereum.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LedgerHQ/plugin-tools.git                          #plugin-tools
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum.git     #app-ethereum
```

## Build

Go to the plugin-tools folder and run the "./start" script.
```shell
cd plugin-tools  # go to plugin folder
./start.sh       # run the script start.sh
```
The script will build a docker image and attach a console.
When the docker image is running go to the "LedgerHQ-app-plugin-THORSwap" folder and build the ".elf" files.
```shell
cd LedgerHQ-app-plugin-THORSwap/tests       # go to the tests folder in LedgerHQ-app-plugin-THORSwap
./build_local_test_elfs.sh              # run the script build_local_test_elfs.sh
```

## Tests

To test the plugin go to the tests folder from the "LedgerHQ-app-plugin-THORSwap" and run the script "test"
```shell
cd LedgerHQ-app-plugin-THORSwap/tests       # go to the tests folder in LedgerHQ-app-plugin-THORSwap
yarn test                       # run the script test
```
## Continuous Integration


The flow processed in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is the following:

- Code formatting with [clang-format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
- Compilation of the application for Ledger Nano S, S+ and X in [ledger-app-builder](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder)
